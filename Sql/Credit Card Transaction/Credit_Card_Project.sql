-- STEP 1 Cleaning Data

		--  Find transactions where credit_card_id is missing.
       
       select * 
         from bank.transaction_detail t1

--  Removing Invalid Data:
        
		--  Delete transactions with a missing or incorrect credit_card_id.
            
				select *  FROM transaction_detail 
WHERE credit_card_id IS NULL OR credit_card_id NOT IN (SELECT credit_card_id FROM credit_card);
            
            
		--  Remove credit cards linked to customers who donâ€™t exist in the customer table.
